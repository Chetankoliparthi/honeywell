    No single public dataset exists for this specific end-to-end process. Instead of using an unrelated dataset, we chose a more robust and challenging path: **we created a high-fidelity synthetic dataset.** This **X-Factor** approach allowed us to:

    - Create balanced and challenging data that tests the model's intelligence.
    - Demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying process physics.
